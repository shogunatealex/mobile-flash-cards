# Mobile Flash Cards

An app designed to test my React Native abilities. This is developed using Expo and React Native as well as Redux. The application allows you to create card decks and add cards to those decks. You can then do a quiz of the cards in the card deck. They will automatically be scrambled each time you do the quiz.


# Installation

This app is quite easy to run. 
1. Just clone it into onto your computer. 
2. cd into the directory
3. run : `yarn install`
4. run : `expo start`
5. Open up the app on your phone with the expo app or using an emulator

The app should pop up in your browser.

NOTE: you can replace yarn with npm and it should work the same.

# Platform Tested

This app was tested on an Iphone XR (with the notch). It has only been tested as far as graphics go on that device. I tried to code it though so that it would work on any apple phone device size.
